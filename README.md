# Snake

A highschool pet project snake game created using pygame. In my excitement at the time combined with the novelty of file operations, I created a homebrew text-based encryption algorithm to store and read the highscore that also erases resets the highscore on the detection of any tampering. Another layer of encryption to veil the encryption algorithm would be necessary for any meaningful security but that was beyond me at the time.
